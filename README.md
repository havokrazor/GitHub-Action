# GitHub-Action
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) tool that allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository. 

## Concept ##

Workflows: Defined in .yml files in the .github/workflows/ directory of your repository. They define a series of jobs that will be run based on events like push or pull_request.
Jobs: A job contains a sequence of steps to be executed. Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially.
Steps: Individual tasks performed in a job (e.g., running shell commands, executing scripts).
Actions: Reusable commands that can be combined in steps to build, test, or deploy your code.
